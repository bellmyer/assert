This is a simple module to facilitate test-driven development in ruby.  If you have a class called life:

    # life.rb
    class Life
    
    end
    
Then you can create a test file for it:

    # life_test.rb
    require 'assert'
    require 'life'
    
    test Life do
      assert "should initialize" do |subject|
        subject.new.instance_of?(subject)
      end
    end

The "test" block will do some cleanup at the end for you, as well as set the "subject" that can be used within the block.
